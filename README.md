# QBUS x OSM - COKE DRIVE with TIMER
Normal Coke Script with an ADDED TIMER and different PROP. I didn't do many changes to the code. TIMER was a main requirement of many people in my circle, so I added that. Also cleaned the Config a bit to remove useless variables.

## CHANGES
- Add a Timer on Bottom of the Screen, that can be customised. 
- Added a CRATE as a prop, cuz I didn't like the Barrel.
- Cleaned the Config file and removed stuff that wasn't being used. 

## SETUP
To change the Amount of Time for TIMER, find `Config.RunTime` and set it to whatever seconds you want. (Try to keep it multiple of 60)

## CREDITS
- Alen for assisting me in Testing the script.
